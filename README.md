## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to be a place for code review/discussion with other Madison Game Dev community members. I structured this as a bare repo and a collection of Pull Requests, since PRs facilitate discussing code. My plan is to leave the PRs open in perpetuity so it's easy to see and add to the discussions.


## Notes on the code
In my day job, I mostly program in higher-level languages (Ruby, JavaScript, etc.) making web applications. I decided to do the AoC challenges in C, because my C is pretty weak and I wanted to get more practice with it. I'm hoping that some of the people who join the discussions here know C better than me and can offer some tips on things to improve.

Specifically, I'm interested in 2 things:

+ **Speed**: Am I doing things that are obviously slow in C? Are there some well-known tricks that I missed? We can talk algorithms, too, if you see ways to reduce the complexity. I'm not (yet) interested in hardcore low-level optimizing, but I do want to know about any glaring perf issues.

+ **Style**: Are there things in my code that would make a seasoned C programmer scratch their head? If there is a more idiomatic way to express something, I want to know. (As I mention below, I banged these out pretty quickly without much thought to readability, so I imagine there will be a **lot** to talk about here.)


## Readability
My goals for AoC were to get a little C programming practice and to have fun. Because of that, I've been writing these programs very quickly, with little thought to structure, maintainability, readability, etc.

At first I considered rewriting them before bringing them to this repo, but then I relized that leaving them in their current gross form could provide an opportunity to discuss refactoring, so here they are in their unedited form.
